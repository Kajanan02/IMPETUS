Impetus 2023

"IMPETUS" magazine is a comprehensive compilation of articles, interviews, and graphics, all centered around the themes of technology and engineering. Initially introduced in 2018 as an online edition, "IMPETUS" magazine made its debut, and in 2022, its second edition hit the shelves as a physical edition.
Now, in 2023, the legacy continues for the third time bringing with it even more innovation and fresh, novel content. There are three distinct competitions to participate in: a digital art competition, an article writing competition, and a comic competition. Impetus offer tech enthusiasts with hidden talents an excellent platform to showcase their skills on a global scale. Valuable cash prizes await the competition winners and the winners  will be highlighted in the artistic IMPETUS annual publication magazine.
